# Timely-Contacts
A new way to use your Contacts. Imagine you need to call one or two groups of customers for a whole week, you can put their contacts in a viewpager accessing them with a simple swipe. But you have also two interesting features: automatic phone call (you can set an interval to recall automatically in case of not answered call), automatica SMS alert (a service that send an SMS after the 5th not answered call). The last feature is particulary useful in Italy where the carriers have made paid for this service. Of course SMS has a cost but nearly everyone here has a monthly subscription which includes free SMS.
